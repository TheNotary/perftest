== Welcome to perftest (rails rig PERFormance TEST)

Have you ever wondered how much perfomance you lost when you went from one NIC to another, or one router to another?  Or even how much longer your pages took to load when you swapped your nginx for Apache with a ton of modules installed.  Well this app is designed to help you gauge how well your rig is able to perform in a very simple way.  

Progress:  It's going to start very simple and as I need more datapoints, I will code them at that time.  If you need something or have any ideas, feel free to send me a message and I'll consider their implimentation.  

The test will involve just the rails app.  A web browser will be used and js will fire off ajax requests and figure out what the response times are and then format a report right there on the web page.    

Currently, the only datapoints tracked are overall response time of each page.  That's pretty lame, but then again, this is the most important factor so I find it to my liking.
